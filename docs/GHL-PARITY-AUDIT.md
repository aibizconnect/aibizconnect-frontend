# GHL Parity Audit — every link, top to bottom

**Directive (Ali, 2026-06-13):** "Start from the top of GHL — we have it for another week — check every link to the end and make our links functional the same way." Our own designs are basic; GHL is the benchmark. This is the working checklist for the whole sweep. We walk the GHL left rail top→bottom; for each item and **every sub-tab** we record our route, real status, and the gap.

Status key: ✅ functional · 🟡 partial (works but missing sub-tabs/depth) · 🔴 placeholder/missing.

Ground truth from a full route audit on 2026-06-13 (16 routes real, see per-row notes). Our nav: `components/LeftNav.tsx`.

## Left rail — top to bottom

| # | GHL item | GHL sub-tabs | Our route | Status | Gap / action |
|---|----------|--------------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Ask AI** (copilot) | inline assistant | — (nav: "soon") | 🔴 | Defer or wire to our agent runtime. Low priority (GHL's is a floating copilot, not a page). |
| 2 | **Launchpad** | setup checklist | `launchpad` | ✅ | Real: steps + follow-up prefs. Compare GHL quick-actions, add if thin. |
| 3 | **Dashboard** | widgets, opp value, funnel | `dashboard` | 🟡 | Real KPIs. GHL has customizable widgets + pipeline funnel chart — ours is fixed cards. Add funnel/conversion widgets later. |
| 4 | **Conversations** | Inbox · Manual Actions · Snippets · Trigger Links | `conversations` | ✅ **MVP shipped (D-297..301)** | Unified inbox live: thread list + pane + composer, SMS/Email/Webchat filter, unread, inbound Twilio webhook (signature-verified), 1:1 reply (SMS+email), ContactDetail Conversations tab. **Needs:** apply migration 0057 + point Twilio number webhook here.

| 8 | **Payments** | Invoices · Estimates · Recurring · Subscriptions · Transactions · Orders · Products · Coupons · Settings · Integrations | `payments` | ✅ **MVP shipped (D-302..306)** | Invoices + Estimates (line items, live totals, statuses, send-as-email, mark-paid→txn, estimate→invoice convert) + Products catalog + Transactions ledger. Customer-initiated **Stripe pay link** (no charge — D-303). **Needs:** apply migration 0058. Defer (honest "soon" tabs): Subscriptions, Recurring, Coupons, Orders; Stripe auto-paid webhook = fast-follow. |
| 9 | **AI Agents** (≈ GHL AI Employee) | Agents · Conversations · Audit | `agents` | ✅ | Ours, ahead of GHL in places (real tool execution, knowledge intake, test console, metering). |

## Build order (top-down, what Ali asked for)

1. **Conversations** (#4) — the unified inbox. *In progress.* Biggest GHL-defining gap.
2. **Payments** (#8) — invoices/products/orders/estimates/coupons.
3. **Opportunities list view + multi-pipeline** (#7) — quick parity win.
4. **Sites depth** (#12) — Forms + Surveys first (lead capture is core), then Blogs.
5. **Marketing depth** (#10) — Social Planner + SMS campaigns + Trigger Links.
6. **Reputation depth** (#18) — Requests + Widgets (Listings needs an integration).
7. **Settings panels** (#21) — Phone Numbers, Email Services, Conversation AI surfacing.
8. **Memberships depth** (#15) — Offers + Analytics.
9. **Decide**: Ask AI / Community / App Marketplace — build or remove from nav (no dead placeholders).

Each item: consult Gemini (architect) → build → report Copilot → tick this list.

## Decisions / notes
- Anything ours-only and good (Strategy, AI Agents depth, Tools) we keep — parity means *match GHL's functional coverage*, not delete our edge.
- "Soon" rows must each end the sweep either **functional** or **removed** — Ali's standard is no dead links.
